## 🚀 Quick Start

Follow these steps to get a development environment up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
-   A modern web browser
-   [Optional, for local Tailwind CSS compilation] Node.js (LTS recommended)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/officialmuneebahmad/something_new.git
    cd something_new
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies** (if you plan to recompile `output.css` with Tailwind CLI locally)
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *Note: The `package.json` is minimal. If `tailwindcss` is not listed, you might need to install it globally or as a dev dependency manually if you wish to modify `input.css` and recompile `output.css`.*

3.  **View the application**
    Since this is a static site, you can directly open the `index.html` file in your web browser:
    ```bash
    # For Windows
    start index.html

    # For macOS
    open index.html

    # For Linux (using xdg-open)
    xdg-open index.html
    ```
    Alternatively, for a better development experience with a local server:
    ```bash
    # If you have 'http-server' installed globally
    http-server .
    ```
    If you don't have `http-server`, you can install it:
    ```bash
    npm install -g http-server
    ```

## 📁 Project Structure

├── data/               # Directory for static data (e.g., product JSON)
├── footer.js           # JavaScript for dynamic footer content
├── index.html          # Main homepage of the application
├── input.css           # Source CSS file (likely for Tailwind CSS directives)
├── js/                 # Directory for additional JavaScript files
├── output.css          # Compiled output CSS file (from input.css, likely by Tailwind)
├── package-lock.json   # Records exact dependency versions
├── package.json        # Project metadata and dependencies (currently minimal)

```

## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts
The `package.json` currently defines a single placeholder script:

| Command | Description                       |
|---------|-----------------------------------|
| `npm test` | Placeholder for testing commands |

### Development Workflow
To develop on this project:
1.  Open `index.html` and `product.html` in your browser.
2.  Modify HTML, CSS (`input.css`), and JavaScript (`footer.js`, `js/`) files.
3.  If you modify `input.css` and have Tailwind CSS installed (locally or globally), recompile your CSS:
    ```bash
    npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./output.css --watch
    ```
    (Ensure `tailwindcss` is installed as a dev dependency or globally for `npx` to work).

## 🚀 Deployment

This project is configured for easy deployment of static assets.

### Production Build
Since this is a static site primarily, the "build" process mainly involves ensuring `output.css` is generated from `input.css` and all static assets are present. The `output.css` is already committed, meaning a build step might not be strictly necessary for deployment unless changes are made to `input.css`.

### Deployment Options
-   **Vercel**: The project's homepage is hosted on Vercel, indicating a direct integration. You can deploy this project instantly by connecting your GitHub repository to Vercel. Vercel automatically detects static sites and deploys them.
-   **Any Static Hosting**: The compiled `output.css`, HTML, and JavaScript files can be hosted on any static web server (e.g., Netlify, GitHub Pages, Firebase Hosting, Nginx).
